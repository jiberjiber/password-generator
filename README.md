# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

```
*that's a long password*
```
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password

```
